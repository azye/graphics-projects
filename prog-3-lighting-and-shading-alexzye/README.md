# Assignment 3

## NOTE
I was unable to complete the normal calculations. The project was done with obj files containing the normals. The resource folder within my repository are files that should work to show the rest of my functionality. You can see my attempts at the calculations in <code>src/shape.cpp</code>. 

Another item that was not completed was the implementation of the different materials.

Hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience. 

## Running
Use the following command to run the program with a specified OBJ file.

<code>./asgn3 ../resources [OBJ file with extension]</code>
